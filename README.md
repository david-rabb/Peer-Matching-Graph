# Peer Matching Graph Algorithms
Algorithms to solve the graph problems of matching students with their peers to evaluate classroom assignments.

## Introduction
In a school classroom, the instructor decides some coursework should be completed in groups. When the groups submit their assignment (whether written, oral, performance, etc.) other students will evaluate their submission. This gives students new depths of understanding the course material as they evaluate other's work and also the chance to receive valuable peer feedback. Given arbitrary classroom sizes, groups sizes and number of evaluations expected, it becomes an algorithmic challenge to evenly distribute peer evaluators across the assignments they are evaluating. How do we guarantee each student submits the same number of evaluations? How do we guarantee each group receives the same number of evaluations? And how do we make sure nobody evaluates himself?
